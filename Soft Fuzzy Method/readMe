The soft_fuzzy.py file contains the python code that incorporates the fuzzy logic while categorizing each sequence into low length, medium length and large length sequences while mining.
The soft_fuzzy.fasta file is the input file that contains leprosy sequences.
The r_softFuzzy_low contains the low length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
The r_softFuzzy_medium contains the medium length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
The r_softFuzzy_high contains the high length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
