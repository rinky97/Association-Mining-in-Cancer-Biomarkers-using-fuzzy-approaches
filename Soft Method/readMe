The soft.py file contains the python code that incorporates the fuzzy logic while categorizing each sequence into low length, medium length and large length sequences while mining.
The soft.fasta file is the input file that contains leprosy sequences.
The r_soft_low contains the low length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
The r_soft_medium contains the medium length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
The r_soft_high contains the high length sequence results that were mined when the .fasta file was run against .py file.
